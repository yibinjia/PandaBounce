# Introduction
This is a Super Mario type game. The main character is a panda, and you need to jump over all obstacles to reach the goal.

# How to start it

Canvas Boilerplate is the go-to solution for quickly creating modern canvas pieces using ES6 and webpack.

1. Get into "pandaBounce" folder
2. Input these commands:
```npm install```
```$env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"```
```npm start```

Your canvas piece should open up automatically at http://localhost:3000 and you should see 'HTML CANVAS BOILERPLATE' on hover.

The original framework is from git clone https://github.com/christopher4lis/canvas-boilerplate.git
